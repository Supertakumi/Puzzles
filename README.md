#Puzzles

Puzzles is a mini project aiming to develop skills as a javascript developer. It is inspired by the puzzles presented in Head First Ajax with some modifications.

It was developed when I was learning basics of Ajax. The first two puzzles 1. Eight puzzle and 2. Fifteen puzzle are similar as the ones given in the book. The third puzzle i.e. Woggle puzzle has major modifications like allowing the user to play with it for some predefined time.
