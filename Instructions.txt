	(i.e. localhost/Puzzles/puzzle-select.html).


2.	This version of Puzzles incorporates 3 kinds of puzzles.
	a.	Eight Puzzle
	b.	Fifteen Puzzle
	c.	Woggle Puzzle

	The home page 'puzzle-select.html' contains links to theses puzzles.


3.	First two puzzles (a. & b.) do not require any server-side interaction. 
	So there is no need to intall or run a server on your machine.

4.	The third one (c. Woggle Puzzle) requires server-side interaction,
	as it contains a .php file. 

5.	The default time for the Woggle Puzzle is 90 seconds. You can change it
	according to your comfort by changing 'woggle.js' in js folder.
	All you have to do is to change   var timerCount = 90; to 
	var timerCount = <your time in seconds>;
